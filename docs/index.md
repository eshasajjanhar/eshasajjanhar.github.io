Hello! I'm a student of Physics and Astronomy with an interest in observational Astrophysics. I'm currently pursuing a post-graduate diploma in advanced studies and research (dipASR) in Physics at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India. Despite the confusing name, it's functionally the final year of a 4-year undergraduate degree (see more [here](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/the-ashoka-scholars-programme/)).

I'm currently working on a thesis under Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya studying quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray source GX339-4 using data from the Indian satellite AstroSat. I enjoy good books, bad movies and all kinds of music. Here you can find some of my work and interests. You can reach out to me [here](mailto:esha.sajjanhar@gmail.com).
