Hello! I'm a PhD student at the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), TIFR, Pune. I'm currently completing my coursework at the IUCAA-NCRA graduate school. I have a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics as well as a post-graduate diploma in advanced studies and research (dipASR) in Physics from Ashoka University in Sonipat, India. At Ashoka, I worked on an undergraduate thesis under Prof. Dipankar Bhattacharya where I studied quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in GX339-4 using X-ray data from AstroSat. I enjoy good books, bad movies and all kinds of music. Here you can find some of my work and interests.
