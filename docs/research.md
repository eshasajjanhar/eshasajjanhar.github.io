I'm interested in accretion onto supermassive black holes and the effects of accretion-related instabilities on AGN feedback. I am trained in multi-wavelength data reduction and analysis- specifically in X-ray, radio, and optical as well as basic knowledge of gwpy for graviational wave detector data. You can find details of past and ongoing projects below!

# Multi-Scale Radio Study of NGC 3516
<img src="/docs/assets/research/AB942.png" alt="image of precession model" width="600">

NGC 3516 is a low-redshift changing-look Seyfert galaxy with an S-shaped kpc-scale radio jet. This S-shaped morphology is also visible in its emission line gas, at a much smaller scale. I studied the morphology of the radio jet using archival data from the Very Large Array (VLA). I found that the S-shape of the jet could be explained using precession of the jet ejection axis. You can find the project report [here](/assets/research/VSRP_Report_Esha_Sajjanhar.pdf).
